## Add comments to old code or code in progress
Something about Knuth's literate programming.

## Write a better README
A README is a file that includes a detailed description of a project directory.
They typically include a broad overview of what the project does, why it was made, and the rationale behind the way it was implemented.
They also usually include instructions for how to install, run other otherwise make sense of the code and its components.
READMEs may also include links to other related resources, recognize the roles of various contributors, update users regarding the status of the project, and indicate the project's overall orientation.

[makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) is a great resource that provides excellent tips for writing clear and helpful readmes.
They also provide handy templates that you may adapt for your own purposes.

## Archive your code in long-term repository
Reference Zenodo's GitHub integration.
Mention Software Heritage.
Reference the GitHub / Internet Archive uploader tool.
tDAR?

## Something about assigning version numbers
List of various versioning schemes: https://nesbitt.io/2024/06/24/from-zerover-to-semver-a-comprehensive-list-of-versioning-schemes-in-open-source.html

Some notable schemes:

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Calendar Versioning (CalVer)](https://calver.org/)
- [Intended Effort Versioning (EffVer)](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/)
- [Romantic Versioning (RomVer)](https://romversioning.github.io/romver/)
- [Alternative Versioning (AltVer)](https://altver.org/)
- [Sentimental Versioning](https://github.com/dominictarr/sentimental-versioning)

## Document your research group’s coding guidelines
Develop some solid practices.
Ensure they are actionable.
Maybe something like "good enough" practices.

DO NOT assign this task to the most technical person in the room.
DO make plans to revisit this document one month, six months, etc in the future --- mark it down in your calendar now!

## Add an open license
Visit [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) for detailed information on software licenses.

Note that software licenses are distinct from licenses intended for non-software materials, such as data, media, documentation and fonts.
choosealicense.com also includes info on non-software licenses: https://choosealicense.com/non-software/

There is also an info page on what happens if you don't choose a license: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/

The Hippocratic License hosts a tool for creating a custom license including language suited to various parameters which you can mix and match at your own discretion, including explicit allowances and restrictions for various communities of potential use-cases, such as an Fossil Fuel Divestment module, a Law Enforcement module, and a Supply Chain Transparency module: https://firstdonoharm.dev/build/

## Add a citation file to your repo
Add a cff file, which includes information that can be picked up by a reference manager to generate clean citations: https://citation-file-format.github.io/

## Write some contributor guidelines
Reference the Mastodon Server Covenant: https://joinmastodon.org/covenant

Reference the Archaeological Ethics Database: https://archaeologicalethics.org/

Ensure that there are mechanisms to follow through on these guidelines; they are meaningless unless they can be backed by action.

## Develop a roadmap or checklist of things to do
https://open-innovation-projects.org/blog/creating-a-comprehensive-open-source-project-roadmap-a-step-by-step-guide-for-successful-development

## Acknowledge contributors
It's all about community!

Acknowledging contributors coming from under-represented backgrounds may help foster more inclusive developer communities, which is great for enhancing the quality of both communities and codebases.

## Make a video demo of your code in action
## List your project in a community registry
- https://open-archaeo.info/
- https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir

## Cleanup your working directories
## Archive abandoned projects
Acknowledge when it's time to tuck a project away, and mark it as archived.
This will put a banner on your repo and restrict any new pull requests.

If a project has been picked up by others, or the work continues in another forum, make sure to provide a link!

## Volunteer to review for the Journal of Open Source Software
## Browse critical research on software development practices
## Donate to FOSS projects
While many archaeologists who write code enjoy stable incomes, many others do not.
In fact, archaeologists who write code tend to be disproportionally of dis-empowered employment status (https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue67/13/full-text.html)

## Post about your work
Make it known that you're making cool stuff, and that anyone can use it!
People may find even the most casual and thrown-together projects useful, if not in practice then as inspiration for building upon and improving!
