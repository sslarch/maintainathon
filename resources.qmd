### Write a better README
A README is a plaintext file that includes a detailed description of a project.
It's typically located in the root directory, and often includes:

- A broad overview of what the project does, why it was made, and the rationale behind the way it was implemented
- Instructions for how to install or run the code
- Links to other related tools or resources
- Recognition of various contributors
- Status updates, feature roadmaps, and an overview of the project's overall orientation

For additional support on how to make or improve your readme, visit [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/). It provides excellent tips for writing clear and helpful readmes and templates that you may adapt for your own purposes.

### Add comments to old code or code in progress
Code comments appear as silent (i.e. non-functional) text embedded in the source code.
They communicate what functions or series of standalone operations do and a brief description of how they are situated in broader workflows.

They may also include notes and task lists for iteratively improving existing functions.

Here is a great write-up about how to write effective code comments: [How to Write Professional Code Comments: A Beginner's Guide to Better Code Documentation (dev.to)](https://dev.to/anurag_dev/how-to-write-professional-code-comments-a-beginners-guide-to-better-code-documentation-27hf)

Some qualities of good code comments include:

- Clear and concise
- Easy to remove once a fix has been implemented
- Explain the "why", not the "what"
- Written for your future self

Here are some examples of great code comments:

<!-- Make this appear as a two in-line columns -->

<!-- 
```r
xxx

```

```r
xxx

``` -->


### Archive your code in long-term repository
Digital media is notoriously impermanent.
Platforms that host code go offline, which may make it difficult to access and share project repositories.
While they may provide very useful collaboration features, commercial platforms like GitHub and GitLab should not be trusted as long-term stewards.
Professional archives should instead be used to backup public-facing code repositories.

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is a general-purpose open repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN, which allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts.
One of its key features is direct [integration with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content), and once configured, saves a snapshot of each release.
For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted.

[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) is another archive dedicated to preserving publicly accessible code.
It regularly crawls several software forges and package indexes, and anyone can [upload their own repositories](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/) too.

### Develop a release strategy
Sharing code as a series of stable releases makes it easier to share code with predictable functionality.
As new features are implemented, they should be rolled into a newer release.

This enhances clarity for what users can expect when they download a specific release.
It also makes it easier to communicate and de-bug issues raised by users by ensuring that all parties are accessing the same codebase.

There are [numerous schemes](https://nesbitt.io/2024/06/24/from-zerover-to-semver-a-comprehensive-list-of-versioning-schemes-in-open-source.html) for releasing code, which enable developers to communicate the degree of changes made between versions.

Some notable schemes include:

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
  - Major, Minor or Patch versions indicate breaking changes relative to prior versions.
- [Alternative Versioning (AltVer)](https://altver.org/)
  - Tracks implementation of major overhauls, new features, and careful maintenance.
- [Calendar Versioning (CalVer)](https://calver.org/)
  - For "rolling" releases that follow a regular maintenance cycle.

### Add a license
Licenses describe legal right for accessing, using and modifying code.
Open licenses, which enable widespread and uninhibited use, are increasingly common, however copyleft or opinionated licenses impose restrictions that add conditions based on specific use-cases.
For instance, [CC-NC limits reuse to non-commercial applications](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation), [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) forces downstream applications to adopt an equally permissive license for any derivative works, and numerous other licenses are aligned with specific social causes.

Note that software licenses are often distinct from licenses intended for non-software materials, such as data, media, documentation and fonts.

Visit [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) for an extremely detailed survey and comparison of various software and non-software licenses.

There is also a page describing what happens if you don't choose a license: [No License](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)

[The Hippocratic License hosts a tool](https://firstdonoharm.dev/build/) for creating a custom license, including explicit allowances and restrictions for various potential use-cases, such as a Fossil Fuel Divestment module, a Law Enforcement module, and a Supply Chain Transparency module.

### Add a citation file to your repo
Add a [cff file](https://citation-file-format.github.io/), which includes information that can be picked up by a reference manager to generate clean citations.

### Develop a roadmap or checklist of things to do
It may be helpful to develop a plan of action to structure future work.
Some factors to consider include:

- What features are on the horizon?
- What steps need to be taken to achieve them?
- What resources will be needed to ensure effective action?
- Who can I call on for support?

Effective roadmaps have tangible and measurable outcomes, and are comprised of tasks that can actually be acted upon.

### Acknowledge contributors
Open source projects thrive based on community support, and acknowledging contributors is a great way to maintain enthusiasm among the team.
This can be done in the README, on social media, and in any other venue where you share your work (journal articles, conference presentations, etc).

When acknowledging the people behind the code, be sure to describe **_how_** people contribute, including specific things they've done to move the project forward.

Highlighting the roles of contributors coming from under-represented backgrounds may also helo foster more inclusive developer communities, which is great for enhancing the quality of both communities and codebases.

### List your project in a community registry
It may be beneficial to include your project in a community registry to ensure that the work is findable and accessible by target audiences.

Archaeologists may consider reaching out to [open-archaeo.info](https://open-archaeo.info/), which is a list of open source software and resources developed by and for archaeologists.
[AncientMetagenomeDir](https://www.spaam-community.org/AncientMetagenomeDir/#/) is a similar resource specializing on tools developed in support of ancient DNA research.

Additionally, the [archaeology CRAN task view](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology) lists numerous studies that include publicly accessible R code, which is a great resource for understanding how the community uses R in their research.

### Archive abandoned projects
Acknowledge when it's time to tuck a project away, and mark it as [archived](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories).
This will put a banner on your repo and restrict any new pull requests.

If a project has been picked up by others, or the work continues in another forum, make sure to provide a link in the original README!

### Donate to FOSS projects
While many archaeologists who write code benefit from access to a stable income, many others do not.
In fact, archaeologists who write code tend to be precariously employed.

Even a small donation shows deep appreciation, and can help motivate labour performed largely by volunteers.

If you are able to provide financial support, please reach out to the maintainers of your most-used tools!

### Post about your work
Make it known that you're making cool stuff, and that anyone can use it!
People may find even the most casual and thrown-together projects useful, if not in practice then as inspiration for building upon and improving!

Maybe something like "good enough" practices.

DO NOT assign this task to the most technical person in the room.
DO make plans to revisit this document one month, six months, etc in the future --- mark it down in your calendar now!


### Write some contributor guidelines
Reference the Mastodon Server Covenant: https://joinmastodon.org/covenant

Reference the Archaeological Ethics Database: https://archaeologicalethics.org/

Ensure that there are mechanisms to follow through on these guidelines; they are meaningless unless they can be backed by action.

### Volunteer to review software
You may think, wait, is this something for a maintainathon? We say yes! Software reviews are valuable for people maintaining the software. It may give hints about what to improve and what to keep just as it is, as it works perfectly already. A review also raises awareness for the software, which is great for developers and potential users alike.
The [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/about) is one such place to write about research software. They have a certain scope and focus on the developer side of things. If there is a smaller software package you would wish to review
or you would like to focus on less technical details, other journals may be a better place. The Archäologische Informationen, e. g., are happy to take software reviews (such as [Thiery et al 202](https://doi.org/10.11588/ai.2022.1.95272) ). This journal also published [Recommendations for the review of archaeological research software](https://doi.org/10.11588/ai.2020.1.81423),
which might help you think of questions to ask yourself in regards to the software you are reviewing. Smaller reviews may also be a good topic for a blog or a social media post. Such appraisals are very valuable for researchers looking for the best solution to their problem!
